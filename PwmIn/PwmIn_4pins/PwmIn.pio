; algorithm:

; loop:
;    reset y, the 'timer' for the pulsewidth (high period)
;    reset x, the 'timer' for the low period. (high + low = period)
;    wait for a 0, then wait for a 1: this is the rising edge
;    loop: 
;       decrement y timer
;       test for falling edge 
;    y timer value is the pulse width (actually, (0xFFFFFFFF - x)*2/125MHz is the pulse width)
;    loop:
;       test for rising edge
;       decrement x timer
;    x timer is the low period (actually, (0xFFFFFFFF - x)*2/125MHz is the low period)
;    push both y and x to the Rx FIFO
;    notify via relative IRQ
